# Exposed PCB Macropad

My hackpad is a 4 key macro pad with two leds all controlled by the seed studio XIAD RD2040 and uses QMK firmware.

It will be used to help me experiment further with electronics and coding plus be useful for studying!

# Features

A open top case to show of a coloured pcb and on a 5 degree tilt for ease of use

4 keys

2 SK6812MINI leds so i can set keys to toggle and the led will display if it is toggled or not

# Cad Model:

The pcb will drop into place for easy access and the top is open to display the pcb (meaning no top part of case) plus it has a 5 degree tilt! It was all made in one piece.
